 *                          fallback paths that miss writes.
 *   - buildPreamble():     called from cursor-connect-stream send-time,
 *                          gated only by BackendCapability.continuityStrategy.
 *   - invalidateOnSwitch:  called when route.backend or route.model changes
 *                          mid-conversation. Mirrors the spirit of
 *                          stripSignatureBlocks but at the reasoning layer.
 *   - clear():             explicit reset (e.g. when the user starts a
 *                          fresh conversation in the same session, or when
