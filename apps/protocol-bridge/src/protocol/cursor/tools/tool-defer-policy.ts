/**
 * Tool defer-loading policy.
 *
 * Decides which Cursor tools are sent to the upstream with their full
 * `description` + `input_schema` payload (the **core surface**) and which
 * are downgraded to a one-line entry in the system prompt catalog (the
 * **deferred surface**).  Deferred tools are not advertised to the model
 * as callable; the model must first call `discover_tool({ tool_name })`
 * to retrieve the full schema, after which the bridge promotes the tool
 * back into the core surface for subsequent turns of the same session.
 *
 * Why this lives in the cursor protocol layer (and not a per-backend
 * translator):
 *   - Every upstream — kiro / anthropic / google-claude / codex /
 *     openai-compat / claude-api — sees the same already-trimmed tool
 *     list.  Down-stream translators are unchanged; they keep formatting
 *     "the N tools handed to them" into their target wire shape.
 *   - The `discover_tool` mechanism is fully bridge-internal: the
 *     upstream models see it as just another tool whose result is some
 *     JSON schema text.  No protocol extension is required on any
 *     upstream.
 *
 * Backend-specific tuning lives in `pickStrategy()` so we can be more
 * aggressive on backends that do not support prompt-cache hits (kiro,
 * google-claude) and more conservative on backends that do (anthropic
 * firstParty's own cache mechanism is more efficient than defer when it
 * actually serves cache_read).

/**
 * Curated set of always-loaded tools.  Mirrors claude-code's `CORE_TOOLS`
 * intent: file read/write/search, shell, plan/todo, sub-agent, basic
 * web — the operations a model will reach for in the *first* response
 * of almost every coding task.
 *
 * Selection criteria:
 *   - High call frequency across realistic agent traces (≥ 5% of turns).
 *   - Cheap to keep (description + schema < ~500 tokens).
 *   - Required for the model's first plan-step (e.g. `read_file`,
 *     `grep_search`) so the model does not get stuck doing a pointless
 *     `discover_tool` round-trip on its very first action.
 *
 * Tools NOT in this set are eligible for deferral.  A few notable
 * exclusions and the reason:
 *   - `task` / `task_v2` / `await_task` — kept here because the
 *     description carries the dynamically-built sub-agent registry;
 *     deferring would force the model to discover before it knows what
 *     `subagent_type` values are even possible.
 *   - `web_search` / `web_fetch` — kept; described as a single sentence
 *     each and used in nontrivial fraction of debugging turns.
 *
 * Names here are the post-translation user-facing names returned by
 * `cursor-tool-mapper.ts`'s `CURSOR_TOOL_DEFINITIONS[*].name`, NOT the
 * `CLIENT_SIDE_TOOL_V2_*` proto identifiers.

 *   - google-claude: similar — no Anthropic-style cache passthrough.

 *   - claude-api (firstParty Anthropic): real prompt cache exists; we

 *     the tools array between turns as the model discovers more tools.
 *     Stay off here.
 *   - google: not Claude, but Gemini still benefits from smaller prompts.
