/**
 * Async buffer channel — fan-in fan-out helper.
 *
 * Used by the Cursor BiDi tool dispatcher to multiplex an arbitrary
 * number of concurrent sub-generators onto a single AsyncIterable<Buffer>
 * that the main BiDi stream consumes. Producers call `push(buffer)`
 * from any task; the consumer calls `[Symbol.asyncIterator]()` once and
 * reads buffers in arrival order.
 *
 * Why the official agent.v1 protocol needs this:
 *   - A single parent agent turn can emit N independent tool_use blocks.
 *   - Each tool_use must traverse `executePreparedToolInvocation`,
 *     which yields ExecServerMessage / interactionUpdate / inline
 *     result buffers as it goes.
 *   - Sub-agents (the `task` tool) can run for tens of seconds; folding
 *     them into the parent's `yield*` chain serially means the next
 *     sub-agent (or any other tool in the same batch) only starts
 *     after the previous one completes.
 *   - With this channel we instead start every sub-generator
 *     concurrently and interleave their outputs as they emit, which is
 *     what the protocol allows (`is_parallel_worker = 7` exists for
 *     exactly this). Edit serialisation is preserved on a per-path
 *     basis by `ChatSessionManager.acquireOrQueueEdit`, so the bridge
 *     never lets two writes to the same file race.
 *
 * Backpressure is intentionally NOT implemented. Buffers carry already-
 * encoded protocol envelopes which are tiny (typically <2 KB) and the
 * downstream BiDi sink reads as fast as the network can flush, so the
 * unbounded queue is fine in practice. If we ever need backpressure,
 * `push` becomes async and pauses on a high watermark — but doing that
 * eagerly without measured pain would only hurt latency.
 *
 * Failure semantics:
 *   - `push` after `close()` is a no-op (returns false). Producers
 *     that want to know if their write was actually accepted check the
 *     return value.
 *   - `error(err)` causes the consumer's `for await` to throw on the
 *     next pull, after every already-buffered chunk has been drained.
 *     Mirrors stream.Readable error semantics.
