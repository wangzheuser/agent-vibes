/**
 * Multi-root workspace boundary resolver.
 *
 * Two responsibilities, intentionally co-located so all callers see
 * the same normalization rules:
 *
 *  1. **Normalize a path for boundary comparison.**
 *     Apply `realpathSync` (resolve symlinks), then collapse the
 *     macOS `/private/var` ↔ `/var` and `/private/tmp` ↔ `/tmp`
 *     pairs that the OS exposes as two physical paths to the same
 *     directory. This matches claude-code's `pathInWorkingPath`
 *     semantics so `/tmp/foo` and `/private/tmp/foo` are treated as
 *     identical paths.
 *
 *  2. **Decide whether a candidate path is inside any allowed
 *     workspace root.** The allowed set unions:
 *       - `projectContext.rootPath` (legacy single-root field, kept
 *         for back-compat — equals `workspaceFolders[0].path` when
 *         workspaceFolders is populated, but the field stays around
 *         because old persisted sessions may not have
 *         workspaceFolders).
 *       - `projectContext.workspaceFolders[].path` (multi-root
 *         from IDE — Cursor `RepositoryIndexingInfo` etc.).
 *       - `additionalRoots[].path` (REST API + config file).
 *
 * The resolver is **stateless** — every public function takes the
 * inputs it needs and returns a value. State (the additionalRoots
 * map, IDE-pushed workspaceFolders) lives on `ChatSession` and is
 * passed in. This keeps the resolver trivially testable (no Nest DI,
 * no fixtures) and makes it explicit which pieces of session state
 * affect boundary decisions.
 *
 * Memoization is deliberately NOT done here. `realpathSync` on a
 * 5-character `/foo` path is sub-microsecond; the boundary check
 * happens once per tool call. Caching would just introduce stale-
 * resolution bugs when the user `mv`s a directory mid-session.

 * regardless of which form was supplied, we collapse the two by
 * stripping the `/private` prefix when it precedes one of these

/**
 * Normalize a path for boundary comparison. Steps:
 *
 *   1. `path.resolve` → produce an absolute path. Relative paths are
 *      resolved against `process.cwd()`, which is the bridge process
 *      cwd (typically the workspace root); callers that need a
 *      different base should pass an already-absolute path.
 *   2. `realpathSync` → resolve symlinks. Falls through silently
 *      when the path doesn't exist (boundary checks frequently run
 *      on paths that haven't been created yet — e.g. the user
 *      asks the agent to write a new file in an allowed root). In
 *      that case we still return the resolved absolute form
 *      (without symlink expansion) so the prefix comparison still
 *      works against ancestor directories that DO exist.
 *   3. `stripMacosPrivatePrefix` → collapse `/private/var` ↔ `/var`.
 *
 * Returns the normalized absolute path. Never throws — when both
 * `path.resolve` and `realpathSync` fail, returns the input
 * unchanged so callers can still compare it (it just won't match
 * any normalized root).
