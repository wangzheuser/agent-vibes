/**
 * Forced language directive.
 *
 * The bridge sits between the Cursor IDE (and other Anthropic-format clients)
 * and every LLM backend. Reasoning models — especially in interleaved thinking
 * blocks — tend to drift to English even when the user is clearly writing in
 * another language. To keep the thinking/response language anchored to the
 * user we inject an explicit directive into the system prompt of every backend.
 *
 * Detection strategy (deliberately narrow):
 *   - Language detection is delegated to `tinyld` (a pure-JS n-gram detector
 *     with inlined model data, so it bundles cleanly into the SEA binary).
 *   - We only NAME a language in the directive when it is on a small allowlist
 *     (currently Chinese). Naming a language emits a hard "you MUST respond in
 *     X" instruction that pins the thinking block — this is what fixes the
 *     English-drift problem for Chinese users.
 *   - Every other detection result (English, Japanese, anything tinyld returns,
 *     or no confident result) falls back to the GENERIC directive ("follow the
 *     user's language"). The model handles those languages on its own.
 *
 * Why the allowlist instead of naming whatever tinyld returns: naming the WRONG
 * language is strictly worse than not naming one — it overrides the model's own
 * (usually correct) judgement with a false hard instruction. Restricting named
 * anchoring to Chinese means a rare misdetection only ever degrades to the
 * generic directive, never to "respond in Japanese".
 *
 * English is intentionally NOT on the allowlist: it is the model's default
 * drift target anyway, so the generic directive already produces English for
 * English input, and omitting it removes the risk of a misdetected Chinese
 * message being forced into English.
 *
 * All public functions accept `messages: unknown` so call sites can pass their
 * backend-native message arrays (Anthropic DTO messages, Codex messages, the
 * raw cloned payload's messages) without type friction; non-array / malformed
 * input degrades gracefully to the generic directive.
