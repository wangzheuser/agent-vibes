## Overview

Agent Vibes is a unified agent gateway for AI coding clients.
It not only translates protocols between clients and backends,
but also implements Cursor's native ConnectRPC/gRPC agent channel with the full streaming tool loop,
while routing requests across Antigravity, Claude-compatible, Codex, OpenAI-compatible, and Kiro (AWS CodeWhisperer) backends.

**Clients** (front-end):

- **Claude Code CLI** — Anthropic Messages API
- **Cursor IDE** — Protocol-compatible ConnectRPC/gRPC implementation

**Backends** (back-end):

- **Antigravity IDE** — Google Cloud Code API with protocol-compliant requests
- **Codex CLI** — OpenAI-compatible API for GPT and Codex models
- **Claude-Compatible API** — Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` with third-party keys
- **Kiro (AWS)** — AWS CodeWhisperer / Q Developer streaming endpoint via Builder ID, IdC, or social login

> **Disclaimer:** This project is for educational and research purposes only.
>
> Using this proxy may put your Antigravity account at risk of being banned. Proceed at your own discretion.

## Compared with [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI)

CLIProxyAPI is the closest reference project for this repo, but the focus is different.
CLIProxyAPI is primarily API-first and CLI-oriented. Agent Vibes puts its main weight on
native client compatibility for Cursor and native upstream fidelity for Antigravity.

- **Cursor:** instead of stopping at OpenAI/Claude-compatible endpoints,
  Agent Vibes implements Cursor's native ConnectRPC/gRPC agent channel
  with protocol-compatible protobuf definitions for interoperability,
  and implements the streaming tool loop directly.
- **Antigravity:** this repo's main Antigravity path is a newer
  worker-native approach, built around running Antigravity's own runtime
  and modules so Cloud Code requests stay protocol-compliant,
  with quota-aware worker rotation around that model.
- **Credits:** this project ports and adapts code from many open-source projects.
  The Claude Code CLI and Codex CLI integrations are primarily based on
  CLIProxyAPI, rebuilt in a TypeScript/NestJS architecture. The Cursor native
  protocol layer and Antigravity worker pool are original implementations.

## Quick Start

### Install Option 1: Prompt Install (Recommended for non-developers)

Copy the prompt below and send it to any LLM (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini, etc.).
It will guide you through the entire installation and configuration process,
and fix issues by analyzing the source code and your environment:

```text
Please guide me through installing, configuring, and testing the Agent Vibes Cursor extension.
Answer in Chinese and prefer executable commands.

Follow these steps in order:

1. Environment check
   - Check my OS, architecture, Cursor version, Node.js version, and whether `cursor` CLI is available.
   - Confirm I am using a compatible Cursor version for this release.

2. Download and install the VSIX
   - Download the correct VSIX from GitHub Releases:
     <https://github.com/funny-vibes/agent-vibes/releases>
   - Install it with the correct command for my platform.

3. First launch and forwarding setup
   - After installation, tell me to open or fully restart Cursor.
   - The extension should auto-start the local service.
   - Guide me through the forwarding setup prompts.

4. Full Cursor restart
   - After forwarding is completed, explicitly remind me that I must fully restart Cursor once before continuing.

5. Account configuration
   - Use Dashboard > Accounts as the primary path for account setup.
   - If needed, also use Command Palette sync commands or open the corresponding accounts JSON files for manual configuration.

6. Testing and verification
   - Verify the service is running.
   - Verify forwarding is active.
   - Verify at least one backend account is configured.
   - Use Dashboard > Diagnostics to run all checks and confirm each one passes:
     proxy bypass, SSL certificates, DNS resolution, traffic forwarding, bridge health,
     end-to-end TLS (H2), and backend accounts.
   - Note: some Diagnostics tests may silently pass on platforms where the check is not
     actually implemented. Cross-check the test source code against the user's current
     platform and environment to determine if the result is trustworthy.

7. Troubleshooting
   - If any step fails, analyze the source code:
     <https://github.com/funny-vibes/agent-vibes>
   - Also analyze my current environment and provide a concrete fix.
   - Prefer minimal, executable repair steps.
   - Key areas to check based on required configuration steps:
     * Proxy environment: is a system proxy or TUN/VPN intercepting Cursor domain traffic?
       Analyze the forwarding scripts to understand how proxy bypass is handled.
     * SSL certificates: do the local CA and server cert exist, are they trusted by the OS,
       and do they cover the required domains?
     * Forwarding chain: is the full path (DNS → loopback → port relay → bridge) connected?
     * HTTP/2 TLS: does connecting to a Cursor domain resolve to a local address with valid
       cert and H2 negotiation?
     * The forwarding/proxy scripts may themselves have bugs — read the source to confirm.
   - Bridge log files are under the OS temp directory (`os.tmpdir()`):
     * macOS: `/private/var/folders/.../T/agent-vibes-bridge.log`
     * Linux: `/tmp/agent-vibes-bridge.log`
     * Windows: `%TEMP%\agent-vibes-bridge.log`
     * Detailed protocol logs: `<tmpdir>/agent-vibes-logs/`

8. Bug reporting
   - If the fix succeeds and we confirmed a real bug, help me prepare a GitHub issue with `gh issue create`.
   - Let me review and confirm before submitting.
```

### Install Option 2: Extension Install (Cursor IDE)

For the Cursor client side, a free account is enough. No paid Cursor plan is required.

One-click download + install from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/funny-vibes/agent-vibes/releases):
Compatible Cursor version: `3.4.16`.

#### macOS Apple Silicon

```bash
# Download
curl -L -o agent-vibes-darwin-arm64-0.1.27.vsix https://github.com/funny-vibes/agent-vibes/releases/download/v0.1.27/agent-vibes-darwin-arm64-0.1.27.vsix

# Install
cursor --install-extension agent-vibes-darwin-arm64-0.1.27.vsix --force
```

#### macOS Intel

```bash
# Download
curl -L -o agent-vibes-darwin-x64-0.1.27.vsix https://github.com/funny-vibes/agent-vibes/releases/download/v0.1.27/agent-vibes-darwin-x64-0.1.27.vsix

# Install
cursor --install-extension agent-vibes-darwin-x64-0.1.27.vsix --force
```

#### Linux x64

```bash
# Download
curl -L -o agent-vibes-linux-x64-0.1.27.vsix https://github.com/funny-vibes/agent-vibes/releases/download/v0.1.27/agent-vibes-linux-x64-0.1.27.vsix

# Install
cursor --install-extension agent-vibes-linux-x64-0.1.27.vsix --force
```

#### Windows x64

```powershell
# Download
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/funny-vibes/agent-vibes/releases/download/v0.1.27/agent-vibes-win32-x64-0.1.27.vsix" -OutFile "agent-vibes-win32-x64-0.1.27.vsix"

# Install
cursor --install-extension agent-vibes-win32-x64-0.1.27.vsix --force
```

Restart Cursor after installation.
The extension auto-starts the proxy server and guides you through first-run setup
(SSL certificates, account sync, network forwarding — all from the Command Palette).

### Install Option 3: From Source (All Platforms)

> **Note:** Primary development and testing is done on macOS.
> Linux and Windows support is implemented but not fully tested —
> scripts may have edge-case bugs on those platforms. PRs welcome!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/funny-vibes/agent-vibes.git
cd agent-vibes
npm install && npm run build
npm link                          # makes `agent-vibes` available globally
```

Generate SSL certificates:

```bash
# Install mkcert first: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation
mkcert -install
agent-vibes cert
```

Cursor requires HTTPS interception — one-time setup:

```bash
agent-vibes forward hosts        # Add DNS redirect to hosts file
agent-vibes forward on           # Enable port forwarding
agent-vibes                      # Start the proxy
agent-vibes forward status       # Verify everything is working
```

### Choose One Upstream Source

Antigravity ([Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.google) or [Antigravity Manager](https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager)):

```bash
agent-vibes sync --ide       # from Antigravity IDE
agent-vibes sync --tools     # from Antigravity Manager
```

Claude Code third-party config:

```bash
agent-vibes sync --claude
```

Codex:

```bash
codex --login
agent-vibes sync --codex
```

Kiro (AWS Builder ID / IdC / Kiro IDE):

- **Easiest:** open Dashboard → Accounts → Kiro → Add account → **Builder ID** tab.
  The bridge starts an OAuth device flow, opens your browser, and writes the
  resulting tokens to `~/.agent-vibes/data/kiro-accounts.json`.
- **From an existing Kiro IDE / AWS CLI login:** Command Palette →
  `Agent Vibes: Sync Kiro IDE Credentials`. The bridge scans
  `~/.aws/sso/cache/*.json` and Kiro IDE's
  `globalStorage/kiro.kiroagent/kiro-cache/` and imports any usable tokens.
- **Manual paste:** Dashboard → Accounts → Kiro → Add account → **Token** tab.
  Paste any of: an SSO cache JSON, a `kiro-auth-token.json`, or the
  `kiro-accounts.json` shape itself.

### Extension Commands

The extension keeps a small set of installation / configuration commands in the Command Palette, while the Dashboard handles most runtime management and detailed operations.

### Daily Use

#### Cursor IDE

- Open Cursor; the extension will auto-start the local bridge.
- To confirm runtime status, open the Dashboard and check Overview, Accounts, Logs, and Diagnostics.
- Send a real request in Cursor to verify that account setup, routing, and tool calls are working.

#### Claude Code CLI (optional)

If you also want to connect Claude Code CLI to the same local proxy, use:

```bash
agent-vibes                  # start proxy
```

In another terminal:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://localhost:8000
claude
```

> **Tip:** Add `export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://localhost:8000` to your shell profile to make it persistent.

## Backend Configuration Reference

### 1. Antigravity

Use for Antigravity / Google Cloud Code access.

Configuration:

```bash
agent-vibes sync --ide
agent-vibes sync --tools
```

Behavior:

- Credentials are synced into `~/.agent-vibes/data/antigravity-accounts.json`.
- Supports multi-account rotation.
- **Claude model routing:** When Claude Code CLI routes through the Google backend,
  only **Opus** models use the Claude-through-Google (Cloud Code) path.
  Non-Opus Claude models (Sonnet, Haiku, etc.) are automatically redirected to
  **Gemini 3.1 Pro High**, preserving Claude quota for complex agentic tasks.
- **Quota fallback (opt-in):** When all Google Cloud Code accounts are quota-exhausted
  and the cooldown exceeds the max wait threshold, the system can automatically fall back
  to a configured Gemini model instead of returning a 429 error.
  Configure by adding `"quotaFallbackModel"` to the top level of `antigravity-accounts.json`:

```json
{
  "quotaFallbackModel": "gemini-3.1-pro-high",
  "accounts": [...]
}
```

Set `"quotaFallbackModel"` to the desired fallback model ID, or remove the field entirely to disable (default: disabled — returns 429 as before).

### 2. GPT

Use for GPT models.

Configuration:

- Codex:

```bash
codex --login
agent-vibes sync --codex
```

- OpenAI-compatible file: `~/.agent-vibes/data/openai-compat-accounts.json`

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "label": "provider-1",
      "baseUrl": "https://a.example.com/v1",
      "apiKey": "sk-xxx"
    },
    {
      "label": "provider-2",
      "baseUrl": "https://b.example.com/v1",
      "apiKey": "sk-yyy",
      "proxyUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:7897",
      "preferResponsesApi": true,
      "maxContextTokens": 200000
    }
  ]
}
```

Behavior:

- Codex and OpenAI-compatible both support multi-account rotation.
- If both OpenAI-compatible and Codex are configured, GPT requests go to OpenAI-compatible first.
- When quota is exhausted, the system automatically switches to the next available account.
- `proxyUrl` routes requests through the specified HTTP/SOCKS proxy for that account.
- `preferResponsesApi=true` uses the OpenAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`) instead of Chat Completions.
- `maxContextTokens` sets a per-account input/context cap. When multiple OpenAI-compatible accounts are eligible, the bridge clamps to the
  smallest configured cap among the currently available accounts so rotation and failover stay within the provider window.

### 3. Claude API

Use for third-party Claude-compatible APIs.

Configuration:

- `agent-vibes sync --claude` reads `~/.claude/settings.json` and writes or updates a managed `claude-code-sync` entry in `~/.agent-vibes/data/claude-api-accounts.json`.
  The managed entry mirrors the current source settings; if the source no longer declares explicit model IDs, stale managed `models` are removed so
  dynamic discovery can take effect.
- Or edit `~/.agent-vibes/data/claude-api-accounts.json` manually:

```json
{
  "forceModelPrefix": false,
  "accounts": [
    {
      "label": "anthropic-official",
      "apiKey": "sk-ant-xxx",
      "baseUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com"
    },
    {
      "label": "third-party",
      "apiKey": "sk-third-yyy",
      "baseUrl": "https://claude.example.com",
      "maxContextTokens": 200000,
      "stripThinking": true,
      "proxyUrl": "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080",
      "prefix": "team-a",
      "priority": 10,
      "headers": {
        "X-Custom-Header": "value"
      },
      "excludedModels": ["claude-3-*"],
      "models": [
        {
          "name": "claude-opus-4-6",
          "alias": "claude-4.6-opus-thinking"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Behavior:

- Unprefixed Claude models prefer the Claude API backend when a matching account exists, and fall back to Antigravity/Google Cloud Code.
- `forceModelPrefix=false` means a prefixed account exposes both `claude-sonnet-latest` and `team-a/claude-sonnet-latest`.
- `forceModelPrefix=true` requires explicit prefixed requests for prefixed accounts.
- Prefixed models such as `team-a/claude-sonnet-latest` only route to the matching Claude API account prefix.
- If `models` is omitted, the proxy first tries to discover models from upstream via `GET /v1/models`;
  if discovery is unavailable, it falls back to the built-in defaults and still allows Claude-family passthrough.
- If `models` is configured, the explicit mappings take precedence and automatic discovery is skipped for that account.
- `stripThinking=true` removes Anthropic thinking fields before forwarding for providers that only support the base Claude model name.
- `excludedModels` supports case-insensitive wildcard patterns such as `claude-3-*`, `*-thinking`, or `*haiku*`.
- `maxContextTokens` sets a per-account input/context cap. When multiple Claude API accounts can serve the same model, the bridge clamps to the smallest
  configured cap among the currently available candidates so retries do not overflow a smaller provider window.
- Official `api.anthropic.com` accounts use `x-api-key`; third-party endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer ...`.

### 4. Kiro (AWS CodeWhisperer / Q Developer)

Use for Claude Sonnet / Opus / Haiku via AWS Builder ID, IAM Identity
Center (IdC), or social-login Kiro accounts.

Configuration (any of):

- **Builder ID OAuth (recommended):** Dashboard → Accounts → Kiro → Add → **Builder ID**.
- **Sync local cache:** Command Palette → `Agent Vibes: Sync Kiro IDE Credentials`. Imports tokens from `~/.aws/sso/cache/` and Kiro IDE's `globalStorage`.
- **Manual paste:** Dashboard → Accounts → Kiro → Add → **Token**.

Behavior:

- `authMethod`: `"idc"` (Builder ID / IdC, needs `clientId` + `clientSecret`) or `"social"` (GitHub / Google).
- AWS does not return Anthropic cache token counts; the bridge simulates `cache_read_input_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens` client-side.
- Refreshed tokens are written back to `~/.agent-vibes/data/kiro-accounts.json` and re-refreshed every 15 minutes in the background.

## SSH Remote Development

When Cursor IDE is connected to a remote machine over SSH (the workspace
lives on the remote host, not on your laptop), agent traffic is generated
by the remote-side `cursor-server` process. The local hosts file /
loopback redirect that powers Agent Vibes on a regular workstation cannot
intercept that traffic — yet most users have no `sudo` on the remote
host to set up a second bridge there.

To handle this case, the bridge ships an HTTP forward proxy that lets
the remote `cursor-server` route Cursor traffic back to the bridge
running on your laptop, **without root on the remote**.

### How it works

```text
┌─ Local laptop (Cursor IDE host) ──────────────────────────┐

│  HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:18080                        │
│  cursor-server / agent runtime                             │

│  127.0.0.1:18080  (reverse-tunneled to your laptop)         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For Cursor agent domains the proxy splices the TLS connection straight
to the local bridge. For any other host the proxy behaves like a normal
HTTPS proxy and connects to the real upstream, so the remote shell can
keep using `HTTPS_PROXY` for everything.

### Setup

Configure on your local laptop (one-time):

1. Make sure the bridge is running. On startup the banner now shows:

   ```text
   ▸ SSH proxy http://127.0.0.1:18080
   ```

   The proxy binds to loopback only and is opt-out via
   `FORWARD_PROXY_ENABLED=false` or `FORWARD_PROXY_PORT=0`.

2. Open the SSH connection with a reverse tunnel that exposes port 18080
   on the remote host:

   ```bash
   ssh -R 18080:127.0.0.1:18080 user@remote-host
   ```

   Or add it to `~/.ssh/config`:

   ```sshconfig
   Host my-remote
     HostName remote-host
     User myuser
     RemoteForward 18080 127.0.0.1:18080
   ```

Configure on the remote host (each shell, no sudo):

1. Trust the bridge CA so HTTPS verification passes inside Node-based
   agents. Copy the CA from your laptop (`~/.agent-vibes/certs/ca.pem`)
   to the remote host once and point Node to it:

   ```bash
   # on the remote host
   mkdir -p ~/.agent-vibes/certs
   # copy ca.pem from your laptop, e.g. via scp from your laptop:
   #   scp ~/.agent-vibes/certs/ca.pem \
   #       user@remote-host:~/.agent-vibes/certs/ca.pem
   export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=$HOME/.agent-vibes/certs/ca.pem
   ```

2. Point the agent runtime at the proxy and start `cursor-server`:

   ```bash
   export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:18080
   export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:18080
   # then launch / restart cursor-server in the same shell, e.g.
   #   ~/.cursor-server/bin/cursor-server &
   ```

   Persist by adding the same exports to `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` /
   `~/.profile`.

### Troubleshooting

- `curl -x http://127.0.0.1:18080 https://api2.cursor.sh/health` on the
  remote host should return `{"status":"ok",...}`. If it hangs, check
  that `ssh -R` is active and that `127.0.0.1:18080` on the remote
  really forwards back to your laptop.
- `tls: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` —
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` was not set or points at a CA that does not
  match the bridge certificates. Re-copy `ca.pem`.
- The remote agent runtime ignores `HTTPS_PROXY` — confirm the env vars
  are exported in the same shell that starts `cursor-server`. Some
  launchers (`systemd --user`, tmux panes that pre-date the export)
  keep stale env.
- The proxy refuses the connection — verify the bridge is running
  (`▸ SSH proxy ...` banner line) and that no other process is listening
  on `127.0.0.1:18080` on your laptop.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### `agent-vibes forward on` does not take effect when a system-wide TUN proxy is enabled

Symptom: after running `npm run cursor:forward:on` (or `agent-vibes forward on`),
Cursor still cannot reach the bridge, Diagnostics report DNS/forwarding failures,
or `curl https://api2.cursor.sh/health` hangs.

Root cause: a system proxy in **TUN mode** (Clash Verge, Mihomo, V2RayN TUN,
sing-box, etc.) intercepts traffic at the network layer **before** the local
hosts file rewrite or loopback redirect can take effect. Even when proxy rules
declare `127.0.0.0/8 -> DIRECT`, the upstream resolver may already have hijacked
`localhost` / Cursor domains into a fake-ip range, so the IP-CIDR rule never
matches.

Fix (using Clash Verge Rev as an example — other TUN clients have equivalent
settings):

1. **Bypass loopback and private ranges from the TUN interface.** Add to the
   global merge / override config so it survives subscription updates:

   ```yaml
   tun:
     enable: true
     stack: system
     auto-route: true
     auto-detect-interface: true
     route-exclude-address:
       - 127.0.0.0/8
       - 192.168.0.0/16
       - 10.0.0.0/8
       - 172.16.0.0/12
   ```

2. **Exclude local domains from fake-ip resolution** so DNS hijacking does
   not rewrite `localhost` into the fake-ip pool:

   ```yaml
   dns:
     fake-ip-filter:
       - "localhost"
       - "*.localhost"
       - "*.local"
       - "*.cursor.sh"
   ```

3. **Add explicit DIRECT rules at the top of the rule list** so they take
   priority over `MATCH,PROXY`:

   ```yaml
   rules:
     - DOMAIN,localhost,DIRECT
     - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,.local,DIRECT
     - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,cursor.sh,DIRECT
     - IP-CIDR,127.0.0.0/8,DIRECT
     # ... existing rules
   ```

4. Reload the proxy configuration, then re-run `npm run cursor:forward:on`.

If you only need a quick test without changing the proxy config, switching
the TUN client to **Rule** mode (or temporarily disabling TUN) is enough to
verify whether TUN is the cause.
